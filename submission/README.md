# Holy-BioMole
We are students in Biomolecular Sciences from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, and we think proteins are cool (but shouldn't be too cool, it would ruin their nice curves) 🙌


### Project Description
We are working on the `antibody-pairing` challenge.
To predict using our model, press "Open Application" on the left. 

### Scoreboard
You can track the performance of our predictor in the [challenge scoreboard](https://biolib.com/biohackathon/antibody-pairing-scoreboard/).
