# Holy-BioMole

We are students in Biomolecular Sciences from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and we think proteins are cool (but shouldn't be too cool, it would ruin their nice curves) ðŸ™Œ


### Project Description
We are working on the `antibody-pairing` challenge.
To predict using our model, press "Open Application" on the left. 

### Scoreboard
You can track the performance of our predictor in the [challenge scoreboard](https://biolib.com/biohackathon/antibody-pairing-scoreboard/).
