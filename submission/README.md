# Holy-BioMole
We are students in Biomolecular Sciences from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and we think proteins are cool (but shouldn't be too cool, it would ruin their nice curves) ðŸ™Œ


### Project Description
We are working on the `antibody-pairing` challenge.

Our current best predictor (version 0.0.6) applies one-hot encoding to the pair of possible interacting heavy and light chain sequences provided in the input and classifies the possibility of interaction using a LightGBM classifier.

We are currently working to improve the prediction by considering biochemical features extracted from the data, such as amino acid content and auto-cross correlation of the chemical properties of the amino acids.

To predict using our model, press "Open Application" on the left. 

### Scoreboard
You can track the performance of our predictor in the [challenge scoreboard](https://biolib.com/biohackathon/antibody-pairing-scoreboard/).
